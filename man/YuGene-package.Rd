\title{
Transforms expression datasets to cumulative proportion for comparison
using YuGene transform
}
\description{
YuGene is a simple transform that answers the question: where is my gene of interest? across a range of datasets without the need to re-normalise datasets under consideration.

This package provides a single function (YuGene). It takes a log transformed dataset (ie multiple microarray samples in an experiment) and converts the values to a cumulative proportion. Values close to zero have the lowest expression, and values close to 1 have the highest expression. When many datasets have been YuGene transformed, relative expression levels (YuGene values) can be directly compared across experiments without re-normalization without significant loss of sensitivity when compared to quantile normalized data.
